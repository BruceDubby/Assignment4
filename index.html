                <p>The main reason why DC comics outshine Marvel comics is because the characters in the universe are more unique and more empowering. 
                One of the most popular heroes in the DC universe is Bruce Wayne, otherwise known as Batman. 
                One reason he is so popular with fans is because he is a regular human who has trained himself to be great. He is also a vigilante. 
                While Marvel may have vigilantes, none of them are as popular as DC’s vigilantes, which include Batman and Green Arrow. 
                Vigilantes are characters who work outside the law, which can be empowering to societies because it supports the idea of fighting for changes to things that are unjust in your own society. 
                One hero that is very empowering is Superman. While some may believe he is overpowered, I believe that Superman has some of the most difficult villains to fight, therefore he should have lots of powers. 
                Superman is one of my favorite heros because of how inspiring he is. The same goes for Supergirl. </p>
