                    The main reason why DC comics outshine Marvel comics is because the characters in the universe are more unique and more empowering.
                    One of the most popular heroes in the DC universe is Bruce Wayne, otherwise known as Batman.
                    One reason he is so popular with fans is because he is a regular human who has trained himself to be great. He is also a vigilante.
                    While Marvel may have vigilantes, none of them are as popular as DC’s vigilantes, which include Batman and Green Arrow.
                    Vigilantes are characters who work outside the law, which can be empowering to societies because it supports the idea of fighting for changes to things that are unjust in your own society.
                    One hero that is very empowering is Superman. While some may believe he is overpowered, I believe that Superman has some of the most difficult villains to fight, therefore he should have lots of powers.
                    Superman is one of my favorite heros because of how inspiring he is. The same goes for Supergirl.

                <p>
                    The DC Animated films have a strong fanbase, and for good reason. Many of them are very tightly written films with good grasp on character, action and story and tie all of these elements together in an 1hr and
                    15min to an 1hr and 20mins of runtime-and better than many longer live action superhero films...DC and Marvel.
                    I still don't think people given animation the credit it deserves...because it's animation. Films like Mask of the Phantasm, Batman: Under the Red Hood, Year One,
                    The Dark Knight Returns, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern: First Flight, Justice League: New Frontier, Batman/Superman: Apocalypse, Crisis on Two Earth's, Flashpoint Paradox,
                    Justice League: Gods and Monsters, Superman Vs the Elite, The Batman trilogy (Son, Vs, Bad Blood) and the newly released Teen Titans: The Judas Contract are all as good as superhero films get.

                    DC television universe understands the importance of developing a background for their characters. Now in its fifth season, Gotham is the prequel to the traditional Batman origin story,
                    delving into the backstories of characters essential to the Dark Knight's rise. Fans of Supergirl praise Melissa Benoist's performance as "Superman's plucky little cousin" and enjoy the cross-over episodes with the equally brilliant Arrow.

                    Creating its own multiverse, the DC universe has expanded to include The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow and the soon-to-be Batwoman.
                    Laying the foundation for each individual's story to be told and relationships to be both made and destroyed greatly improves the overall enjoyment of fans watching these shows.

                    From the comics perspective DC has richer more engaging stories. the majority of DC's villains have been overwhelmingly better than those of Marvel. 
                    It can be argued that what hurts Marvel is their heroes never stop being "the hero" and therefore the villains are left as simple stereotypes of the classic "bad guy" who wants to take over the world.

                    What makes DC villains more appealing are the tragic backstories that made them the formidable foes they are where in the case of Marvel, many just turned to the dark side on their own. 
                    Marvel has taken a serious beating because many find their villains non-threatening-- with the exception of Thanos' recent devastating effects from his "Finger-Snap" moment.

                    With the arkham series DC wins this hands down, the new avengers game was a huge disappointment and a money grab. But Marvel alliance isn't bad.

                    While I can't deny Marvel has done a great job with their Live Action Universe, DC wins in all other categories. If you're over 30 and are a Marvel fan, you are traitor.  No one was watching Marvel in the 90's and early 2000's other than
                    spiderman and X-men which were technically Fox.  It was all about BAS (which is considered one of the best animated shows of all time), SAS, Justice league unlimited.  Not to mention DC live action movies go back farther
                    and everone wants to forget about the tragic marvel movies that did come out like the Hulks, the Ghost Riders, the Fanstatic 4's etc..
